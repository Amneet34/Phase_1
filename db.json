The standard setup makes only 717 horsepower, and the version in the Redeye pumps out 797 horses. The 807-hp Super Stock model features dedicated equipment for drag racing. Paired with the optional eight-speed automatic transmission, the last Challenger SRT Redeye Widebody we tested roared to 60 mph in 3.6 seconds and completed the quarter-mile in 11.8 seconds at 125 mph."
